# Python course

I decided to taught my friends how to program, 
so will try to gather here materials

## Structure
Each directory has
 - README.md with notes and links
to the info required to do the exercise.
 - exercise.py will contain exercise with
detailed description what to do
 - one more file with an example of exercise 

Additionally, we may create some automated test
for all exercises later on

## Plan
0. Setup
1. Syntax
2. Essentials
3. Data structures
4. Functions advanced
5. Classes a bit advanced

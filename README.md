# Python course

I decided to taught my friends how to program, 
so will try to gather here materials.

## Goal

The goal is to gather here materials, exercises and projects
to study the most important things to become a python developer (in my opinion).
I'm not focusing too much in explaining the basics,
so my expectation is that you've already completed few courses,
but still don't understand where to go further.

I will try to explain what is good and bad in programming and why it is like that.

We will build applications incrementally with changing
requirements, so you will face problems with code scalability.

Although, mostly you will need to read/watch info from different sources.

## Roadmaps
1. [Backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
2. [Python](https://roadmap.sh/python)


## Contributions
You can create issues and ask to add my explanation of preferred themes.

You can add materials to existing READMEs or fix any typos/errors and create PR.

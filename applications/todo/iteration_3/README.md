# Task

This will be a small one.

I've created new file `types.py` and added dataclasses to represent our Todos and Actions.

Now use Todo dataclass everywhere instead of dicts.

I already updated `DATA` variable, you can copy other functions
from previous iteration and adjust them

Use Action dataclass to represent actions.

Use `ACTIONS` (first add needed actions there) list to create action choices

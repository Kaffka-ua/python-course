# Task


Now let's add a feature!

So the problem we have is that all info we add vanishes
after we exit our app.

So now you will learn about json (more info [here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp))

Basically json is a dict, and we can save it in file, and load it from file

So, you need to implement this, use `json.loads` and `json.dumps` for this.

Look at `data.json` file to see the structure, keep it the same

You will have code from my example already in main, but you can use yours if you wish

P.S. Make sure you handle exceptional situations and file will always contain the latest data from app

P.P.S. If you think that you can make read/write of file whenever you need, then you are a bastard!
Reading writing file is very expensive operation, so think how to read date from file once and write also only once.

Good luck!

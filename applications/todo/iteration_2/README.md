# Task

Most likely you've had a lot of pain during previous iteration task.

But now you will suffer.

Most likely your code have a lot of duplicates,
so here are some requirements this time (it's recommended to complete them in the order)

1. Make sure you are validating that user inputs int, when it's needed (remember number guesser?)
2. You should have different function for each action (CRUD + list)
3. You have few places where you need to show list of todos, reuse function `list_todos`
4. Make sure that once a todo is created, it's id is unique and is equal to the current max id + 1

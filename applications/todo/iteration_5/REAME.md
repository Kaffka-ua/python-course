#Task

Now lets take it to a whole new level.

I want you to allow multiple users to have their own todos.

^_^

Okay we won't do this in 1 iteration, so here I want you to do the following

1. Rename `types.py` into `models.py` (will explain this later).
2. Add model named User with the following fields  `id` `name` `created_at` (you should pick types on your own).
3. Create function to create user.

For this iteration you won't have an example.

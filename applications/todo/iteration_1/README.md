# Task

You will need to create the most basic implementation of todo app.

For this application it will be quite hard to write tests (but maybe I'll find the way around),
so this you should check on your own.

You have a [video](https://youtu.be/hdfgFYSKZaw) that show flow of an app, so you need to match them.

In next iterations you will face some technical requirements,
so you will be practicing code refactoring (changing code, and it's structure without changing functionality).

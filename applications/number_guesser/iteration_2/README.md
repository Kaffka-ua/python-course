#Task

As you can see, you can make only 1 guess in 1 program run,
that's not so cool
Now change your program so you can make
infinite amount of attempts,
so you can finally guess it

You will have code from example.py from previous iteration.

You will need an infinite loop.

Use `while loop_condition():` for automated testing to work

Make sure you finish program somehow after success

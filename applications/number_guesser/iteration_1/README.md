#Task

Okay so you need to create a simple program which is called number guesser
We will build a nice application in a few iterations

Here is the logic:

1. Define a variable with a random number in range from 1 to 10 (needed function is already imported)
2. Take a user guess as an int (you will need an input function)
3. Compare 2 numbers, if they are the same, call `success` function, else call `fail` function


Write your code in `main.py` file inside main function

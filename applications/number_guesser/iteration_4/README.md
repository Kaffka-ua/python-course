# Task

Okay, I hope it's working,
now try to input not a number,
for example letter E

Yeah, you will to handle this "exceptional" situation ;)

For this you will need a function, let's call it `get_user_input`

Function should not have any arguments,
and return a guess as an int,
you should ask for an input until input is valid,
so yeah while loop once again :)

Make sure to call `wrong_input`
function when user entered not a number

Now use `get_user_input` inside your loop to receive an input

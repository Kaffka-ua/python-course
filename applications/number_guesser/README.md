# Number Guesser
The rules are very simple, computer picks random number and player needs to guess it.

## Testing

To run test you need to be in this directory and call
```shell
python -m unittest iteration_*/test.py
```
This will run all the tests for all iterations,
to run test only for one iteration replace `*` with iteration number

Also, you can add verbosity to output by adding `-v` parameter at the end

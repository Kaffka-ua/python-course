## Install PyCharm

[Configure interpreter](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html)

## Install git

[Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Read the first chapter at least

Further reading is highly encouraged, but here is the bare minimum

### Clone repository

`git clone link_to_a_repositry`

e.g this will clone this repository into your current folder

`git clone https://github.com/KeSHaMI/python-course`

Clone command automatically creates [remote origin](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

### Getting updates

`git pull remote_origin_name branch_name`

e.g this will get updates for this repository

`git pull origin main`

For now, you won't any other commands,
although it would be cool if you can create fork
of repository and push commits with complete exercises to your fork
